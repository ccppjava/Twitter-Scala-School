however which is for version 2.8.x, in 2.9.0.1, the grammer does not work
it need more complex grammer to have same effect.

compose:
scala> val ummThenAhem = (addAhem(_)).compose(addUmm(_:String))
	ummThenAhem: (String) => java.lang.String = <function1>

andThen:
scala> val ahemThenUmm = (addAhem(_)).andThen(addUmm (_))
	ahemThenUmm: (String) => java.lang.String = <function1>
